"""
There's an algorithms tournament taking place in which teams of programmers
compete against each other to solve algorithmic problems as fast as possible.
Teams compete in a round robin, where each team faces off against all other
teams. Only two teams compete against each other at a time, and for each
competition, one team is designated the home team, while the other team is the
away team. In each competition there's always one winner and one loser
there
are no ties. A team receives 3 points if it wins and 0 points if it loses. The
winner of the tournament is the team that receives the most amount of point
